Title:
Elephant–Human Conflict Simulation in React

Description:
This project is a 3D interactive simulation built using React that demonstrates an elephant–human conflict prevention concept. The model shows an elephant emerging from the forest and approaching a human settlement. As it nears the community, a simulated sensor system activates—triggering blinking alerts and bee sounds—prompting the elephant to retreat back into the forest.

Features:

* 3D environment showcasing forest and human community scenes.

* Elephant movement simulation toward the community.

* Sensor detection when the elephant reaches the danger zone.

* Visual alert (blinking) and audio cue (bee buzzing) to repel the elephant.

* Elephant returns safely to the forest after detection.

Use Case:
This project serves as a proof of concept for wildlife conservation technology, focusing on human–elephant conflict mitigation through early detection and non-lethal deterrents.

Tech Stack:
1.)React – Frontend framework.
2.)Three.js / React Three Fiber – For 3D model rendering and animations.
3.)JavaScript – Core logic.
